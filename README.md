## COMP3010: Algorithm Theory and Design, 2020, Macquarie University

This is the public repository for COMP3010: Algorithm Theory and Design, offered in Semester 2, 2020 at Macquarie University. The main purpose for this repository is to make it easier to share files and materials that you need for this subject. We can also make use of the wiki section of this repository to post extra notes. 

I plan to write all of the Java codes in this repository using JDK 14.0.2 with complier compliance level 12, i.e Java 12, but I imagine even Java 8 will also be compatible.
The repository was also built so that you can easily import and run these codes using Eclipse. If you are not using Eclipse, then you need to use to clone this project and manually add them to whatever IDE or text editor you are running.

You do not need to understand Git for this subject, but as a third year computing student, you should have a good understanding of the basics by now. If you do need to learn Git, then head over to https://www.atlassian.com/git and read the Beginner articles. At the very least, you should understand what a pull means.

## How to use this repository

Every week, if there are any Java source code that you can use in the workshops or to supplement the lecture material, then they will be released here. I also plan to release the code base for your assignments via this repository. In the workshop instructions, I will make it clear which files you can modify and which files you should not, but this won't be a hard and fast rule. You are free to experiment and modify any file that I upload. However, there may be cases where I need to update or change a file after I upload it for the first time, so if you have already modified that file locally, you may have to perform a git merge. If you are comfortable with merging, that's great! Otherwise, I will add instructions for this, if necessary.

## Configuring Eclipse to work with Git

The following is based on the tutorial on https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseGit/article.html. Feel free to follow the tutorial if you want a more complete understanding, but this section should be enough for COMP3010. The following guide (particularly the screenshots) were written using a MacOS, so there could be some differences with other operating systems, but the differences should be minimal.

First, we need to show the Git Repositories sub-window. On Eclipse, select
